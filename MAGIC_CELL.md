# Magic Cell

A magic cell is a cell that is aware of:

- It's coordinates
- The presence of borders and divine interventions inside itself
- A function, mapping border coordinates to determinitic-random values

Furthermore, magic cell may be passed the "void (magic) cell" as input,
considering that this empty cell may be separated from the "useful" area
by a "border".

# Floating cell vs Anchored cell

- Floating cells = Normal cells
- Anchored cells = Magic cells
